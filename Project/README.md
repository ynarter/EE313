##Term project: Analog Multiplier

The goal of this project is designing a multiplier that would multiply two sine waves. Gilbert Cell
is the most commonly used analog multiplier. A sine wave is added to the gate or base of the bias
generator of the differential amplifier. The quiescent current of the input transistors then changes
sinusoidally, i.e. gm is not fixed but varies sinusoidally. The differential output is gmvd, since both
of them are sine waves, multiplication is achieved.

Specifications:
• 12V DC power supply.
• Power consumption is less than 200mW, i.e., <10mA total current per supply.
• Input waves are 1kHz and 20kHz sine waves with 0.1mV amplitude
• The circuit generates its own biasing.
• A double balanced mixing cell is used.

Given 1kHz and 20kHz sinewaves the output of the circuit is the multiplication of these
two signals.

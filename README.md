# EE313
üìÑ Lab and project reports for the EE313 Electronic Circuit Design course at Bilkent University.

üñ•Ô∏èüîå The labs/project consist of two parts: Software circuit design on LTSpice and the circuit's hardware implementation. Refer to the lab reports for detailed explanations and theoretical background of the implementation, along with the specifications and results.

## Term project: Analog Multiplier
The goal of this project is designing a multiplier that would multiply two sine waves. Gilbert Cell is the most commonly used analog multiplier. A sine wave is added to the gate or base of the bias generator of the differential amplifier. The quiescent current of the input transistors then changes sinusoidally, i.e. gm is not fixed but varies sinusoidally. The differential output is gmvd, since both of them are sine waves, multiplication is achieved. Refer to the [project file](https://github.com/ynarter/EE313/tree/main/project) and [report](https://github.com/ynarter/EE313/tree/main/project) for more details.
